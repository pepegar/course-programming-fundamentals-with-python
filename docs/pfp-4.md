Programming fundamentals with Python
====================================


Algorithms
==========

Algorithms describe the sequence of steps to solve a problem

Algorithms
==========

Problem: How does one assemble IKEA furniture?

Algorithms

Problem: How do you search a word in The Dictionary?

Sorting Algorithms
==================

Sorting algorithms study the most performant way of sorting all elements
in a sequence

Sorting Algorithms
==================


Search Algorigthms
==================

Search algorithms try to find whatever you\'re looking for in the most
performant manner

Search Algorigthms
==================

Can you apply the algorithm you thought of for searching in a dictionary
to search in something bigger like\... All posts in Facebook?

Ranking Algorithms
==================

Ranking algorithms try to measure the importance of different nodes in a
graph

Ranking Algorithms
==================

Pagerank. How did google ranked their webpages? (circa 1998)

Ranking Algorithms
==================

H-Index. How does scientific community measure the importance of a
researcher?

Shortest path
=============

Shortest path algorithms try to find the\... well, the shortest path
between two nodes in a graph

Shortest path
=============

Six degree problem

Shortest path
=============

Erdos number

Bacon number

Erdos - Bacon number

Shortest path
=============


Algorithm complexity
====================

There are two units which we measure when checking the complexity of an
algorithm: Time and Space
